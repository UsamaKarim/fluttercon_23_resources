## FlutterCon 23 Resources

**Update: recordings now available!**

I created this repo to collect all the video recordings and slides from the Flutter talks at [FlutterCon 23](https://fluttercon.dev/):

- [Video Recordings](https://www.droidcon.com/content/?filter_category=video&filter_post_event_tag=fluttercon)
- [Agenda](https://fluttercon.dev/agenda/)
- [Speakers](https://fluttercon.dev/speakers/)

## Talks List

Following FlutterCon, I've asked all the speakers to share a link to their slides and I've collected [all the answers](https://twitter.com/biz84/status/1677621155769753601) in the table below. üëá

If your talk is not included and you'd like to add it to this list, please submit a PR (_note: all the talks are sorted in chronological order based on the agenda_). üôè
